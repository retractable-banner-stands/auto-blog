**Usage:** `python3 image_optimizer.py optimize 100`
**Features:**
- Optimizes WebP images to target size
- Maintains aspect ratio and quality
- Batch processing capability
- Quality testing functions

#### 2. `/home/ubuntu/integrated_blog_generator.py`
**Purpose:** Complete blog generation with optimization
**Features:**
- Generates images with MANUS
- Automatically optimizes to <100KB
- Converts to base64 for API
- Submits to BigCommerce via DigitalOcean

#### 3. `/home/ubuntu/MASTER_SESSION_CONTINUITY_GUIDE.md`

**Contains:**
- All eyeBanner brand standards
- API integration details
- Image generation strategy
- Latest AI optimization techniques

### API INTEGRATION:
```python
# DigitalOcean BigCommerce Connector
api_url = "http://206.189.76.235/publish"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-secret": "mySuperSecret123"
}

payload = {
    "title": "Blog Post Title",
    "html": "Clean HTML content with {{image.webp}} placeholders",
    "images": [
        {
            "filename": "image.webp",
            "base64": "BASE64_ENCODED_DATA"
        }
    ]
}
```

### PROVEN RESULTS:
